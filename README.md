# Network Packet Sniffer

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based network packet analyzer tool developed using Scapy. The tool captures and analyzes network packets, providing detailed information about IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. The application includes a Jupyter Notebook explaining the code and its functionality. This tool is useful for learning about network traffic analysis and packet inspection.

## Features

- **Capture Packets**: Capture network packets from all interfaces.
- **IP Analysis**: Display source and destination IP addresses and the protocol used.
- **Payload Inspection**: View payload data of TCP/UDP packets if available.
- **Customizable Packet Count**: Configure the number of packets to capture.
- **Educational Resource**: Includes a Jupyter Notebook explaining the code and its components.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy
